# rip: Image Processing in R

This repository contains R packages intended to provide image
processing tools in R.

The `rip.opencv` package provides an interface to a subset of the
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) computer vision library. See [this
introduction](https://deepayan.github.io/rip/opencv-intro.html) for
details.

The `rip.recover` package provides tools for image reconstruction, and
currently implements a Bayesian approach for image deconvolution and
super-resolution using a "natural" gradient image prior. A short
introduction is available
[here](https://deepayan.github.io/rip/recover-intro.html).
